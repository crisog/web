            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

            <h3>Stateless Solutions | Principal Software Engineer, Backend</h3>
            <p>July 2023 - Present</p>
            <p>At Stateless Solutions, I spearheaded the development of the first production-ready Gateway & Service API, completing it from scratch in under 6 months. This project included comprehensive metrics and visualization dashboards.</p>
            <p>I also developed the Stateless CLI, enhancing API interaction with a seamless user experience. Additionally, I created an Ethereum load testing tool optimized for our specific use case, featuring configurable dynamic RPS, ease of use, and efficiency in Go.</p>

            <h3>Pocket Network Inc. | Software Engineer, Backend</h3>
            <p>August 2021 - July 2023</p>
            <p>At Pocket Network, I led the creation of Portal API V2, a complete Go rewrite of V1, from specifications to implementation. This new system, currently in production, has handled peak loads of 2 billion requests per day while reducing overall costs by 43%.</p>
            <p>It demonstrates exceptional efficiency in both RAM and CPU usage, with a 90% compute reduction compared to V1 and 2.5 times faster latency. I implemented robust metrics for enhanced system observability and reduced logging by 80%, significantly decreasing storage costs.</p>
            <p>As the primary knowledge source for Pocket Protocol and Ethereum, I advocated for transparency in our selection algorithm and drove improvements for fairer reward distribution. I also successfully led technical integrations to add $POKT to over five exchanges, including KuCoin, Gate, and Okcoin.</p>

            <h3>1Hive | Web3 Developer</h3>
            <p>May 2020 - August 2021</p>
            <p>During my time at 1Hive, I set up UniswapV2 contracts and UI for the Honeyswap DEX (honeyswap.org), maintained Celeste backend services (celeste.1hive.org), created xPollinate, a cross-chain assets bridge powered by Connext (xpollinate.io), and deployed the contracts necessary to bridge the $HNY token from xDai to Ethereum Mainnet.</p>

            <h3>Pocket Network Inc. | Web3 Developer</h3>
            <p>February 2021 - April 2021</p>
            <p>In this role at Pocket Network, I wrote a subgraph for a staking contract based on AMPL-TokenGeyser, assisted in developing the mathematical models for rewards, lock schedules, and unlock rates, and configured the entire smart contract deployment and testing suite using Hardhat.</p>

            <h3>Iterativo LLC | API Engineer</h3>
            <p>March 2020 - April 2021</p>
            <p>At Iterativo LLC, I focused on backend development, particularly API Design & Management. I migrated several microservices to FastAPI, successfully created two new products with clean CI/CD pipelines, implemented a self-managed API Gateway and routing using GKE, analyzed cost-effective deployment strategies on Google Cloud Platform, refactored an old API from traditional to serverless architecture, and optimized system-bottlenecking queries, significantly boosting performance.</p>

            <h3>BrightID | Web3 Developer</h3>
            <p>October 2020 - January 2021</p>
            <p>At BrightID, I worked on their IDChain side chain, deploying several DApp forks including Uniswap V2, Uniswap Analytics, Omnibridge, and DaoHaus. I also set up a Graph Node for deploying all necessary subgraphs for these applications, as well as the associated contracts.</p>
